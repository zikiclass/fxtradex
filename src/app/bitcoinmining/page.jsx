            <h1>Bitcoin Mining</h1>

            <p>
              Bitcoin has a public ledger which is called the blockchain. The
              process of mining adds new transactions to this public ledger.
              Why? Well, Bitcoin users need this process because it means that
              every transaction is securely confirmed and verified while all the
              users making use of the Bitcoin network has full access to the
              blockchain – in other words, the Bitcoin ledger. Mining also helps
              the network figure out which transactions are fair and legit,
              eliminating any transactions that try to spend money a second
              time.
            </p>

            <p>
              So when someone “mines” Bitcoin they are in fact performing a
              service to all Bitcoin users because they ensure Bitcoin
              transactions are legitimate. During the process of mining people
              who mine Bitcoin will complete a new block which means that the
              miner gets a reward. In 2018 the return for completing a new block
              was 12.5 Bitcoin, but the reward gets lower with time.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you can imagine, mining requires a lot of hard work and
              patience – you do not get Bitcoin mining results quickly. So
              there&apos;s an obvious analogy with actual, physical mining of
              metals like gold. Hence using the word “mining” for the
              computational tasks that generate new Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Choosing your mining equipment</b>
              <br />
              Mining Bitcoin involves very complex calculations which are very
              computationally intensive. So, choosing the right hardware kit
              when you mine Bitcoin is really essential. You need to think about
              a number of specific characteristics when you choose your Bitcoin
              mining kit.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Hash rates</b>
              <br />
              Perhaps the key aspect of your mining kit choice is this: the hash
              rate that your mining hardware can sustain. Hash rate is basically
              the number of crypto calculations that your mining hardware can
              perform every second. It&apos;s easy to see why a higher hash rate
              will help you mine coins more quickly – simply because more
              calculations per second mean that you solve the crypto math
              required to mine a coin much more quickly. As a result you can
              quickly complete a block and get your reward for doing so.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hash functions work like this: whatever input you insert will
              always give you the same output. So to find a specific output you
              have to try as many random inputs as you can – as fast as you can.
              It makes mining competitive and the miner who can process more
              inputs than other miners will end up getting rewarded faster. So,
              again, if you can get hardware with a high hash rate you will have
              an advantage over other miners which means you get more rewards
              more quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rate of measurements for hash rates is MH/sec, which is short
              for megahashes per second. You can also measure hash rates in
              terms of GH/sec and TH/sec, standing for giga- and terahashes per
              second respectively. Bitcoin mining hardware have hash rates which
              can range from a few hundred MH/sec all the way to 10 TH/sec (or
              10,000,000 MH/sec).
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Cost of energy</b>
              <br />
              There are costs involved with mining Bitcoin, and it&apos;s not
              just the physical mining hardware you need to worry about. If you
              can afford powerful hardware you will quickly find you have
              another headache: the electricity cost associated with driving
              that hardware because powerful mining hardware consume a lot of
              power.
            </p>

            <p>
              When buying hardware you therefore need a close look at the
              electricity consumption of the kit – work it out in watts and then
              see how much it will cost you, so that you don&apos;t get a big
              surprise when you get your next electricity bill. If you
              don&apos;t you risk spending all your mining profits on
              electricity – or indeed face making a big loss.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hash rate alongside energy consumption is a good way to evaluate
              mining profits. Compare the hashes you can complete in an hour
              with the cost of electricity per hour (or per day). An easy way to
              do this is to divide the hash rate of your kit by the watts
              consumed. It&apos;ll give you a MH/s per watt rate which can guide
              you, alongside current electricity costs, to find whether your
              mining kit will produce a profit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don&apos;t forget to include extra costs like the computer
              hardware that drives mining GPUs when you calculate profits - your
              PC will also consume power on top of the mining hardware that you
              have.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Bitcoin mining hardware options</b>
              <br />
              When Bitcoin was just released a wide variety of people paid
              attention as it was a unique idea that people found very liberal.
              In any case, Bitcoin was very revolutionary compared to the way
              transactions were processed before: by centralised banks. This
              self-governing network was outside the remit of financial
              institutions, tax authorities and other big organisations because
              it was completely decentralised.
            </p>

            <p>
              In these early days of Bitcoin less people knew about the
              cryptocurrency and fewer people were buying and investing in
              Bitcoin, so the value of Bitcoin was not as high. The result was
              that it was easy to mine Bitcoin which meant that there were many
              miners interested in mining Bitcoin for profit, but they were also
              interested in Bitcoin because it was such an incredible, novel
              idea. Back then, mining Bitcoin required the use of basic
              computing power – even a laptop was enough, or a powerful desktop
              computer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through this process of mining Bitcoin with laptop and desktop
              computers people started realising that GPUs (graphics cards) were
              capable of really boosting Bitcoin mining ability. GPUs are
              well-suited for Bitcoin mining: GPUs consume less power than a
              computer CPU dedicated to mining and GPUs can mine at 50 to 100
              times the rate.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result dedicated devices which were custom-designed for
              mining was introduced to the market. Mining capabilities
              multiplied and this lead to an interesting development: Bitcoin
              mining farms which were effectively profit centres – and which led
              to the development of a more formal industry dedicated to mining
              Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time Bitcoin mining has become very profitable and a lot of
              serious miners operate very large Bitcion mining farms that
              generate a lot of money. It&apos;s a mix of hardware involved in
              these mining farms – including GPUs alongside powerful coolers to
              keep temperature down. Electricity is a big problem for these
              operations but in some countries electricity prices are low and
              this is why mining farms have concentrated in places with cheap
              electricity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, it does mean that to mine Bitcoin you are up
              against very capable mining operations with a lot of capital
              behind them – it&apos;s basically a competition against big
              companies around the globe that have a lot of money to spend.
              There are still countless individual Bitcoin miners too – and they
              tend to collaborate for profit by joining Bitcoin mining pools.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Choosing a CPU</b>
              <br />
              As much as a CPU is really central to your computer it is not in
              fact the most important part in a Bitcoin mining rig. Yes, back
              when Bitcoin just launched you could mine using a CPU alone and
              you could do it profitably as long as your PC&apos;s CPU had
              enough power.
            </p>

            <p>
              Miners worked hard to maximise their profits however so the result
              is that they tried different types of hardware for mining. They
              quickly found that CPUs are not the best options for mining
              Bitcoin. You still need to use a CPU to power your PC that runs
              the mining rig, but your CPU will take decades to mine a
              meaningful amount of Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>GPUs for mining</b>
              <br />
              There are a lot of different uses for GPUs, or graphics processing
              units – ranging from playing advanced 3D games through to doing 3D
              rendering. In fact, the original design remit for GPUs were the
              ability to calculate the math that allows top-end video games to
              look as good as they do. However, by coincidence, this also meant
              that GPUs are excellent tools for performing hashing functions.
              And, as we know, hashing is key to solving the crypto puzzles that
              solve blocks of Bitcoin transactions.
            </p>

            <p>
              GPUs are not cheap, at several hundred dollars each, but there is
              a huge advantage for GPUs over CPUs when it comes to hashing. A
              good GPU could easily hash at hundred times the rate of a top-end
              CPU. This fact led to the rise of what is called a mining rig: a
              basic computer linked to a large number of GPUs – all dedicated to
              mining and to mine so as fast as possible. However, some people
              used these machines in a mixed-use configuration, for example
              playing 3D games at certain times while mining when they&apos;re
              not gaming.
            </p>

            <p>
              However bad news for GPU mining surfaced quickly: today you cannot
              really mine Bitcoin profitably using GPUs. To cut a long story
              short, the more powerful mining equipment becomes the more
              difficult it becomes to mine Bitcoin. The result is that GPUs can
              no longer effectively mine Bitcoin compared to alternatives –
              which we&apos;ll talk about below. So, you won&apos;t make your
              money back in capital and electricity spend if you use a GPU to
              mine Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>FPGAs in Bitcoin mining</b>
              <br />
              GPUs were soon succeeded by something called a field programmable
              gate array, or FPGA. An integrated circuit, FPGA&apos;s need to be
              configured after they are built but it does mean that a company
              which builds mining kit can buy a lot of FPGA and then set these
              up to be excellent at mining Bitcoin. FPGAs turned out to be a
              great option for mining Bitcoin and it changed the parameters for
              Bitcoin mining – removing GPUs from the playing field.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, FPGA mining rigs were the first mining kit which used
              hardware specifically designed for Bitcoin mining, and which could
              only be used to mine Bitcoin. In one key development it was
              quickly found that FPGA&apos;s used a lot less power than GPUs –
              in fact, for the same hash rate, an FPGA could use less than 20%
              of the power of a GPU – which means mining operations were a lot
              more profitable.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What are ASICs?</b>
              <br />
              The final stage in the Bitcoin mining arms race,
              application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs were chips
              designed from the ground up to mine Bitcoin. You can&apos;t
              program an ASIC, it&apos;s functionality is printed into its
              circuits and in the case of Bitcoin mining rigs ASICs could only
              be used to mine Bitcoin. Good ASICs could mine at 100 times the
              rate while using less electricity. At this stage there is no
              replacement technology for ASICs on the horizon, so ASICs remain
              the fastest way to mine Bitcoin for the foreseeable future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, a custom-designed chip will be time consuming to make
              and fairly expensive. However this expense does come with results
              – a top of the line miner from a company such as AntMiner can get
              you to hash rates which are in the terahashes per second range –
              easily over 10TH/sec. The price? Over a thousand dollars. You get
              cheaper solutions too but the speed will be less. Working out
              mining profitability
              <br />
              Getting your mining profits right is difficult and it does depend
              on hardware choice which is why mining beginners can find the
              choice of hardware a bit overwhelming to cope with. Getting your
              hardware choice right will determine you profits so you need to be
              able to calculate profitability to cover the cost of the hardware
              as well as the electricity you are consuming. It&apos;s important
              that you make this calculation before you spend money on hardware
              because your hardware can be difficult to resell.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thankfully you can consult a pre-built calculator to help you –
              two options include BTC Mining Profit Calculator, which lets you
              add facts like the price you are paying for your hardware plus the
              hash rate you are achieving alongside the electricity you consume
              – it then takes the current price of Bitcoin and tells you whether
              your investment will reap rewards – or just end up costing you
              money. Another calculator you can try is the one from Genesis
              Block.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Choosing mining software</b>
              <br />
              Thought choosing mining hardware will be difficult? You have even
              more choices to make – this time around the software you use for
              mining. You don&apos;t need mining software for all types of
              mining rigs but you probably will – GPUs and FPGAs also need you
              to make available a computer you can use for mining, which acts as
              host for Bitcoin&apos;s client plus the mining software you choose
              to use.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why a Bitcoin client and mining software? Well, the Bitcoin client
              connects your miner to the bitcoin network and the mining software
              is the application which utilises your mining hardware to solve
              cryptography puzzles in order to solve transaction blocks – which
              of course is what you are rewarded for.
            </p>

            <p>
              ASIC system can be pre-configured with software, they could even
              include a Bitcoin address that&apos;s ready to use. All you need
              to do is plug your ASIC miner into a socket and get started. Older
              ASIC rigs however needed separate software to get them going.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which are the most popular Bitcoin mining software options? We
              think you should check out one of these five solutions, depending
              on your exact needs:
            </p>

              <b>Understanding mining pools</b>
              <br />
              The computer resources required to mine Bitcoin has increased to
              the extent that successfully mining Bitcoin now requires you to
              compete against organisations with a lot of money, and which can
              set up big mining farms. So it is hard to mine solo and one of the
              ways to improve your ability to mine Bitcoin is for you to join a
              pool of Bitcoin miners.
            </p>

            <p>
              When pooling your mining efforts you basically give your computing
              resources to the collective mining effort so that blocks can be
              found faster, which means rewards are obtained more quickly. These
              rewards are then split amongst the people who contribute their
              computing resources in a way that&apos;s proportional to their
              contribution. Joining a pool can therefore make your mining income
              more streamlined as you&apos;ll get paid more quickly – even if
              the individual payments could be small.
            </p>

            <p>
              It&apos;s easy to join a pool, you sign up just like you would
              sign up with any other website – by creating an account. You then
              add a worker – or multiple workers if you have multiple rigs – and
              attach the workers to your hardware rigs. Keep in mind that pools
              charge for their services so you could loose between one percent
              and ten percent of your mining rewards. Some pools charge no money
              whatsoever.

              <b>Can you profitably mine Bitcoin?</b>
              <br />
              The profits you can generate when mining Bitcoin has rapidly
              changed over the years as Bitcoin itself has become more valuable,
              while the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased
              exponentially. The early enthusiasts who used CPUs to mine Bitcoin
              will now no longer be able to make any money out of doing so,
              instead the game is in the hands of people who operate
              enterprise-scale mining ventures.
            </p>

            <p>
              So in essence the easily obtainable Bitcoins were mined long ago
              so today mining is incredibly hard, like trying to find diamonds.
              The increasing value and popular appeal of Bitcoin has also drawn
              a lot of new players into the Bitcoin mining scene which makes the
              competition for mining new coins even tougher – it means that you
              simply need more and more powerful computing resources to mine a
              coin.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Specialised mining gear is now key</b>
              <br />
              It&apos;s not that you can&apos;t mine – it just means that to
              make a profit you now need fairly specialised Bitcoin mining gear.
              Individuals trying to mine will often find that they simply spend
              more on the electricity they use to mine than what they get in
              return for mining. In part, access to cheap electricity is key to
              mining Bitcoin successfully today and so is scale – the ability to
              put together a very large mining operation.
            </p>

            <p>
              People who mine at home also need to cope with all sorts of issues
              ranging from the power going out through to hardware that breaks
              down and getting disconnected from the internet – not to mention
              crashed in the price of Bitcoin, which happen occasionally. It
              really is very difficult for people to mine Bitcoin at home and
              make any money at all.
            </p>

            <p>
              That doesn&apos;t mean that the mining at home proposition
              won&apos;t change: ASICs are becoming better and better while the
              software that handles the hardware is also becoming more capable.
              In the future all these factors could change so that individuals
              can again mine Bitcoin at home – which would be a good thing
              because it supports the decentralised aspect of Bitcoin. In other
              words, people mining Bitcoin at home prevents all the power from
              accumulating with a few large players.

              <b>What you need to know about Bitcoin cloud mining</b>
              <br />
              There is an alternative to mining Bitcoin using your own
              equipment. It&apos;s known as cloud mining, and it operates on a
              principal similar to other cloud services. Instead of owning your
              own computer equipment you “rent” mining capabilities from someone
              else. It&apos;s a bit like buying a mining contract and in doing
              so you will be sharing in the vast computing capabilities of the
              company you contract with.
            </p>

            <p>
              Without a doubt Bitcoin cloud mining can be easier than trying to
              do it with your own hardware because there&apos;s no need to worry
              about software, internet bandwidth or the cost of electricity.
              And, of course, you don&apos;t have to pay for the hardware
              either. All you need is an internet connection and ideally your
              own Bitcoin wallet to keep your coins locally.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note though that when you&apos;re outsourcing your mining activity
              to a cloud mining provider you will take a degree of risk. You
              hand over almost all control to the cloud mining vendor.
              That&apos;s why choose only reputable cloud mining providers like{" "}
