              <h4>ADVERTISING ID AND ADVERTISING IDENTIFIER</h4>
              <p>
                The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided
                by Google Play services. If your device has an Advertising ID,
                we may collect and use it for advertising and user analytics
                purposes. We may also use Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA),
                which is a non-permanent device identifier provided by Apple,
                and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising
                Identifier, for the purpose of advertising. By downloading the
                Application or using the Services you explicitly agree that we
                may associate your Advertising ID and your Advertising
                Identifier with your applicable persistent device identifier.
                This will facilitate our ability to improve your personalized
                experience. Further, we may use other persistent identifiers for
                non-advertising purposes. If your device does not have
                Advertising ID or Advertising Identifier respectively, we will
                use other identifiers.
