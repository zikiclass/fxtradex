            <p>
              For those considering investing, it’s important to first
              understand a few key terms. These allow you to appreciate how the
              markets and trading work, so you can form a strategy and make
              decisions that are beneficial to your long-term goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Forming part of this core terminology are two words: margin and
              leverage. “Margin” is a way for investors to increase their buying
              power, which can be beneficial for those whose budgets are modest.
              While it can increase profit, there’s also a greater degree of
              risk inherent in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps you’re also wondering “what does leverage mean in
              trading”? The two terms are often used interchangeably. They both
              refer to ways to open a trading position with a broker using only
              a small amount of capital to take up a large position.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of these terms can be confusing for amateur investors and
              those who’ve yet to enter the markets. However, with this guide,
              you should soon develop a much better understanding of them.

              <b>What is Leverage?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, what does leverage mean? In ordinary parlance, “to leverage”
              is to use something to maximum advantage. Its meaning in the
              financial world is not so dissimilar: you’re taking the funds you
              have and using leverage to optimise your earning potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you were looking for a simplified leverage meaning or leverage
              definition, you might summarise it thus: as a way to take a small
              amount of money and increase its value on the investment markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples are often the easiest way to explain this kind of
              concept. Imagine you have £1,000 to trade but want to increase
              your potential return. You find a broker offering leverage at
              25:1. With their backing, you could manage a position of up to
              £25,000 by placing a deposit of £1,000.
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              <b>What is Margin?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Above, we said “leverage” and “margin” are two terms that are
              often used interchangeably. This is true, but we should qualify it
              by explaining that the two do have slightly different meanings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re searching for a margin meaning, this is the amount of
              money you’ll need to open your position, while leverage is the
              multiple of exposure. If you’d like to know how to calculate
              margin, work out the size of your intended position and then
              divide this by the higher number.
            </p>
            Lots of brokers will have a margin calculator on their page, but
            this is usually easy enough to work out in your head. In the example
            we used above, our hypothetical broker wanted to trade £25,000 with
            leverage of 25:1. The margin formula they’d need to use would
            therefore be:
            <p>£25,000 / 25 = £1,000</p>
            <p>
              Equally, if the leverage was 5:1, they’d have to put down £5,000
              to manage the same size position. The formula in this instance
              would be:
            </p>
            £25,000 / 5 = £5,000
            <p>
              Essentially, this means you work out the margin in the following
              way:
            </p>
            <p>
              Size of position / the higher figure in the ratio = the margin.
            </p>
            <p>
              When buying on margin, the size of your deposit will depend on the
              leverage offered and the trading terms supplied by the broker.
              This payment is known as the “initial margin”. Margin requirements
              can differ widely depending on factors like the asset type,
              market, and risk involved.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              <b>How Does Margin Relate to Leverage?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve largely covered this question above, but let us go into a
              little more detail here. Margin is, essentially, a special type of
              leverage that involves using existing cash or securities positions
              as collateral. This increases the trader’s buying power.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ability is not limitless. If traders have taken on too much
              risk, brokers may put them on a margin call or implement a
              stop-out.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s look at these two concepts individually:</p>
            <p>
              <b>Margin Call</b>
              <br />A margin call occurs when an investor’s balance and
              unrealised profit and loss are equal to their margin requirement.
              The broker will demand they deposit additional funds to bring
              their account up to the minimum value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Stop-out</b>
              <br />A stop-out, on the other hand, is the point where a trader’s
              equity is equal to half their required margin. If you have trading
              positions open but lack the equity to cover these, the trading
              platform will automatically close them. This is implemented as
              part of the FCA’s product intervention measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>How Does Leveraging Work?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, how does leverage work? This is a strategy that involves
              borrowing funds to increase the return on investments. If the
              return is higher than the interest owed, you can make a healthy
              profit, which is why investors utilise it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the {project_name} platform, you must decide whether you
              wish to use leverage or not. There’s no onus on you to do so.
              Different instruments will have various maximum leverage amounts.
              By law, these must not exceed a certain number.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use a leverage multiplier to enhance your buying power.
              This will often be in the form of a ratio, such as 10:1, 20:1, and
              so on. This is the number of times your capital will be amplified.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re wondering “what is leverage ratio” and how you calculate
              the leverage ratio formula, this is easy. The smaller figure
              relates to the money you put down; the larger, to how much the
              broker will amplify this by. So, if the ratio is 10:1 and you
              deposit £1,000 in your account, the broker will increase this
              amount to £10,000.

            <p>Leveraged Buyout and Stop Loss</p>
            <p>
              This works in a not dissimilar way to a leveraged buyout.What is a
              leveraged buyout? Where one company acquires another using a
              significant amount of borrowed money. You’re essentially doing the
              same to secure a larger position.
